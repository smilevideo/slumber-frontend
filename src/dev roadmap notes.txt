home page:
-*chart dropdown to select week
-*chart showing hours slept over past month

sleep overview:
-'remove sleep' button
-*alternative to calendar clicking: user text input to select date range

sleep form:

dream form:
-separate textarea inputs for thoughts/takeaways
-emojis corresponding to relative mood levels next to each number
-form moved to the right side

dream list:
-when positive mood: smile icon, and vice versa

individual sleep page:
-when positive mood: smile icon, and vice versa
-edit sleep
-remove dream
-edit dream
-dream description text should wrap instead of extend the page

navbar:
-grid to get it to work on mobile

misc/overall notes:
-concatenate css files or @import?
-should have followed mobile-first design, layout breaks easily when zooming in
-styling
-don't allow going to pages that you should need to be logged in for
-timeout on requests
-maybe fix bug where app crashes if localstorage has a token but the user no longer exists

## to-do:
- Move token from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie
- Put API url in env variable or something for all action files to access
- Separate out actions by model (user, sleep, etc.) -each one references getUser from user actions

## bugs:
- when refreshing while logged in, navbar momentarily shows the logged-out buttons
- when moving to a different tab while there is an error message, the error message is still there upon return
