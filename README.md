# slumber-frontend
React/Redux frontend for Slumber, a sleep log/dream diary/sleep-performance analytics web app

## Future Improvements:
- Move token from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie

## Bugs to Fix: (will address once more base functionality is finished)
- when refreshing while logged in, navbar momentarily shows the logged-out buttons
- when moving to a different tab while there is an error message, the error message is still there upon return
