# slumber-frontend
React/Redux frontend for Slumber, a sleep log/dream journal.

Uses the date-fns, react-calendar, and recharts packages

Repo for Rails+Postgres backend is here: https://github.com/smilevideo/slumber-backend

## Future changes:
- Move token from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie
- Put API url in env variable or something for all action files to access
- Separate out actions by model (user, sleep, etc.) -each one references getUser from user actions

## Known Bugs:
- when refreshing while logged in, navbar momentarily shows the logged-out buttons
- when moving to a different tab while there is an error message, the error message is still there upon return
